       " For continuous actions, the first coordinate of an action determines the throttle of the main engine, while the second\n",
       " coordinate specifies the throttle of the lateral boosters. Given an action `np.array([main, lateral])`, the main\n",

       " the function `tanh(sin(2 k (t+C)) + sin(pi k (t+C)))` where `k` is set to 0.01 and `C` is sampled randomly between -9999 and 9999.\n",

       "- v2: Count energy spent and in v0.24, added turbulence with wind power and turbulence_power parameters\n",
       "- v1: Legs contact with ground added in state vector; contact with ground give +10 reward points, and -10 if then lose contact; reward renormalized to 200; harder initial random push.\n",

       "## Notes\n",
       "\n",
       "There are several unexpected bugs with the implementation of the environment.\n",
       "\n",
       "1. The position of the side thrusters on the body of the lander changes, depending on the orientation of the lander.\n",
       "This in turn results in an orientation dependent torque being applied to the lander.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. The units of the state are not consistent. I.e.\n",
       "* The angular velocity is in units of 0.4 radians per second. In order to convert to radians per second, the value needs to be multiplied by a factor of 2.5.\n",
       "\n",
       "For the default values of VIEWPORT_W, VIEWPORT_H, SCALE, and FPS, the scale factors equal:\n",
       "'x': 10, 'y': 6.666, 'vx': 5, 'vy': 7.5, 'angle': 1, 'angular velocity': 2.5\n",
       "\n",
       "After the correction has been made, the units of the state are as follows:\n",
       "'x': (units), 'y': (units), 'vx': (units/second), 'vy': (units/second), 'angle': (radians), 'angular velocity': (radians/second)\n",
